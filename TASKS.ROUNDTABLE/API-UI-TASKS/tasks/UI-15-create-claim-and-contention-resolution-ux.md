# UI-15: Create Claim and Contention Resolution UX

## Objective

Implement **Create Claim and Contention Resolution UX** as a production-ready part of the Roundtable admin control plane.

## Product constraints

- Agents must never receive direct repository write controls through this UI.
- Patch application is always mediated by Roundtable's transaction manager.
- Human UI state must reflect the server's authoritative governance state.
- All workspace-scoped requests include the selected workspace context.
- Every live view supports reconnect/resync behavior.
- Every visible control must have a defined action, disabled condition, and failure state.

## Detailed requirements

- Implement the New Claim dialog with resource type-specific inputs and live validation.
- For file/directory resources, support repository-relative picker and reject paths outside repository root.
- For symbol claims, require indexed symbol selection and show defining file.
- For command claims, select from allowlisted command definitions rather than arbitrary shell text unless the policy explicitly permits a raw command claim.
- Contention resolution view must show all contenders, acquisition order, lease TTL, agent priority/policy weight, dependent work, and allowed resolution actions.
- Every manual override requires a reason captured by the API and audit log.

## Data/API wiring

- Use the typed API client from UI-00.
- Initial data is loaded over REST.
- Live changes arrive over the workspace event stream defined in UI-34.
- Query keys must include `workspaceId` and any server-side filter/sort inputs.
- Do not fabricate state transitions in the browser. After a mutation, use the mutation response and/or authoritative follow-up event.
- Surface `request_id` from API errors in the error details affordance for debugging.

## Required UI states

Implement all of the following when relevant:

1. loading skeleton;
2. empty/new workspace;
3. populated;
4. partial/degraded data;
5. stale data while reconnecting;
6. WebSocket disconnected;
7. permission denied;
8. validation failure;
9. optimistic mutation pending only where safe;
10. server conflict (`409`) with refresh/retry guidance;
11. entity deleted or no longer accessible;
12. generic server failure with retry.

## Accessibility and interaction

- Full keyboard access.
- Visible focus.
- Icon-only buttons have tooltips and accessible labels.
- Status is communicated with text/iconography, not color alone.
- Exact timestamps are available even when relative time is shown.
- Tables use semantic headers and preserve readable focus states.
- Dialogs restore focus to their launching control.

## Acceptance criteria

- The feature visually matches the Roundtable admin design system.
- No placeholder button is present.
- All server state is typed.
- Loading/error/empty/reconnect states are covered.
- Critical state-changing actions have confirmation/preflight where appropriate.
- Unit/component tests cover core interaction logic.
- Playwright covers at least one happy path and one failure/permission path.
- Typecheck, lint, unit tests, and E2E tests pass.
