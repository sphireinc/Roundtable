# UI-14: Claims Page

## Objective

Implement **Claims Page** as a production-ready part of the Roundtable admin control plane.

## Product constraints

- Agents must never receive direct repository write controls through this UI.
- Patch application is always mediated by Roundtable's transaction manager.
- Human UI state must reflect the server's authoritative governance state.
- All workspace-scoped requests include the selected workspace context.
- Every live view supports reconnect/resync behavior.
- Every visible control must have a defined action, disabled condition, and failure state.

## Detailed requirements

- Build `/claims` with a live table of resource claims. Types: file, directory, symbol, command, schema, endpoint, test suite, custom resource.
- Columns: claim ID, type, resource, mode, claimed by, owning session, proposal/deliberation, state, acquired, expires/lease, contention count.
- Actions for humans: inspect, release if governance allows, force-release with reason, extend lease, resolve contention, create manual claim.
- Force-release is a high-impact action requiring a confirmation dialog that shows dependent proposals/sessions.
- Visually distinguish shared-read, exclusive, advisory, and execution locks if supported by API.

## Data/API wiring

- Use the typed API client from UI-00.
- Initial data is loaded over REST.
- Live changes arrive over the workspace event stream defined in UI-34.
- Query keys must include `workspaceId` and any server-side filter/sort inputs.
- Do not fabricate state transitions in the browser. After a mutation, use the mutation response and/or authoritative follow-up event.
- Surface `request_id` from API errors in the error details affordance for debugging.

## Required UI states

Implement all of the following when relevant:

1. loading skeleton;
2. empty/new workspace;
3. populated;
4. partial/degraded data;
5. stale data while reconnecting;
6. WebSocket disconnected;
7. permission denied;
8. validation failure;
9. optimistic mutation pending only where safe;
10. server conflict (`409`) with refresh/retry guidance;
11. entity deleted or no longer accessible;
12. generic server failure with retry.

## Accessibility and interaction

- Full keyboard access.
- Visible focus.
- Icon-only buttons have tooltips and accessible labels.
- Status is communicated with text/iconography, not color alone.
- Exact timestamps are available even when relative time is shown.
- Tables use semantic headers and preserve readable focus states.
- Dialogs restore focus to their launching control.

## Acceptance criteria

- The feature visually matches the Roundtable admin design system.
- No placeholder button is present.
- All server state is typed.
- Loading/error/empty/reconnect states are covered.
- Critical state-changing actions have confirmation/preflight where appropriate.
- Unit/component tests cover core interaction logic.
- Playwright covers at least one happy path and one failure/permission path.
- Typecheck, lint, unit tests, and E2E tests pass.
